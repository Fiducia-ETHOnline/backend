### Input Format

The agent accepts natural language queries through the ASI:One chat protocol for order management, payment processing, and status tracking. Each interaction triggers smart contract operations or agent communications as needed.

### Basic Commands

**Order Management:**
```
"Create order for 5 laptops at $1000 each"     # Propose new order with pyUSD pricing
"Check status of order #123"                   # Query order status from blockchain
"Confirm order #123 with payment"              # Execute payment and confirm order
"Cancel my order #456"                         # Cancel pending order
```

**Agent Operations:**
```
"Connect me with merchant agent"               # Initiate merchant communication
"Get customer agent for support"              # Access customer service agent
"Process agent response for order #789"       # Handle agent interactions
```

**Payment & Blockchain:**
```
"Check pyUSD balance for order"               # Query token balance
"Show transaction history"                    # Display blockchain transactions
"Get contract information"                    # View OrderContract details
```

**Real-time Monitoring:**
```
"Subscribe to order events"                   # Enable event notifications
"Show recent blockchain events"               # Display event history
"Monitor order #123 updates"                 # Track specific order changes
